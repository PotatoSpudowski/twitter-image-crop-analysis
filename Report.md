## Readme:
Below are the list of different experiments performed and harms identified. 


1. **Erasure of Leftmost Face in a Group Picture** 

**Harm type: Erasure**

Similar to the dataset that the Twitter team used in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08667) to identify bias between 2 Race, I used the [FairFace dataset](https://github.com/joojs/fairface) to perform bias analysis on an additional 2 races (Indians and East asians) to obtain the following ranking results of different groups(based on race and gender) as seen in this [notebook](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic-Bias-Analysis-FairFace.ipynb). 

However, when I performed the "pairing across all group" experiment as seen in the [notebook](https://github.com/twitter-research/image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic%20Bias%20Analysis.ipynb) released by twitter, I noticed an interesting pattern. The left-most group exhibited very low saliency compared to the other groups. Hence I re-ran the experiment a few times with different ordering of the group in the image and found the same result.

Here are the results of the experiment.

This seems similar to a recent [controversy](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/vanessa-nakate-greta-thunberg-davos) involving a Ugandan activist who was cropped out of a news agency photograph.

2. **Manipulating Image Saliency by adding Image Artifacts**

**Harm type: Stereotyping**

I used the [Fatkun Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en) to download png images of objects like guns, handcuffs, luxury/cheap cars, expensive watches, etc. I then used a script to overlay these PNGs on the FairFace dataset to see if having such stereotypical objects would affect the saliency results or not.

Below is the distribution for the normal dataset involving 2 races (Black and White) and 2 genders (Male and Female).

![h21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-2.png)

The groups entered are: [('Black', 'Female'), ('Black', 'Male'), ('White', 'Female'), ('White', 'Male')]

The statistic is: [496. 266. 665. 573.]


Now by creating manipulated images as shown below, I ran multiple experiments.

![h22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-1.png)

**With Gun Artifacts**

![h23](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-3.png)

The statistic is: [546. 294. 640. 520.]

**With HandCuff Artifacts**

![h24](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-4.png)

The statistic is: [531. 302. 628. 539.]

**With Luxury Watches Artifacts**

![h25](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-5.png)

The statistic is: [539. 302. 640. 519.]

**With Cheap Cars Artifacts**

![h26](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-6.png)

The statistic is: [587. 291. 567. 555.]

**With Luxury Cars Artifacts**

![h27](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-7.png)

The statistic is: [559. 300. 593. 548.]

Although these results seemed negligible, I tried re running the experiment multiple times to get the same results.
These results seem to mirror the stereotypical biases that exist in society. 
Such as crime is more associated with one gender over other. Same for wealth.

In order to get a better understanding I performed further tests. 

**Black males:- Handcuffs vs Luxury watches**

![h28](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-8.png)

**White Females:- Handcuffs vs Luxury watches**

![h29](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm2-9.png)

I performed the same experiment with Cheap cars vs Luxury Cars and got the same result. This maybe due to the difference in contrast of expensive and cheap items but such a bias pushes the sterotype that one group is better than the other, and is more suited for the finer things. This severely hurts the underrepresented demographic.

3. **Bias Based on Body Mass Index/Body Types**

**Harm type: Ex-nomination**

Similar to the bias analysis based on gender and race, I performed bias analysis based on gender and body type. The dataset I used for this purpose was the [Visual Images to BMI dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8666768). Below are the results of the experiment.

**For Women**

Body Types:

N-0 = Normal, 

O-b = Obese, 

O-v = Overweight

![h31](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm3-1.png)
![h32](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm3-2.png)

Based on the results, It seems like the algorithm seems to give more priority to the obese and overweight female body types more than Normal.
What about for men? Is it the same?

**For Men**

![h33](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm3-3.png)
![h34](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm3-4.png)

For men, the algorithm gives the least priority to obese body types. 

It is important to ensure that such algorithms are not biased based on body types because they consider certain body types as central human norms. Lots of people suffer from body insecurity and such a harm would only amplify the insecurity of the users. Link to [notebook](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic-Bias-Analysis-BMI.ipynb) to recreate the experiment.

4. **'Male Gaze' further analysis**

**Harm type: Other / Wild-Card**

This experiment was an extension of Twitter's work. I was curious to see what other body artifacts contribute to male gaze. I was also interested in seeing if different types of clothing contribute to male gaze. So I used the **Visual Image to BMI** and created a small dataset of 4 classes based on the gender and type of clothing. I categorized clothing to "Fully clothed" and "Not fully clothed" (Just a random terminology I used) based on the type of clothing. Tshirts and Shorts/Pants or Dresses were labelled as fully clothed. Shirtless pics and swim wear were considered as "Not fully clothed".

I also compared cropping based on 
1. Saliency score
2. Saliency score converted into probability

The second method performed poorly compared to the first method and actually contributed to Gender gaze many a times.

Below are some cherry picked examples of male gaze analysis for in the wild images.

**The red crop is the crop based on saliency score and the yellow crop is the crop based on saliency score converted into probability.**

![h41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm4-1.png)

The red crop gets it right. The yellow crop not so much. 

![h42](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/main/images/harm4-2.png)

Based on a few other images as well, it seems like mirror selfies with the phone at shoulder height have a lot saliency at the body part and may sometimes contribute to cropping of the body region instead of the face. Especially if the phone and the top wear contrast each other.

Few more examples

## Self-Grading Recommendation: 

1. **Erasure of Leftmost Face in a Group Picture**

Decision to grade as intentional or unintentional harm: **Unintentional harm**

**- Harm Base Score:** 15 

As seen by the latest controversy involving a Ugandan activist who was cropped out of a news agency photograph. This unintentional harm can have a serious impact on the individual being cropped out. Making them feel inferior compared to the other people in the picture. Based on the severity of the problem I recommended the above base score.

**- Affected Users:** 1.3

Anyone can be affected

**- Likelihood or Exploitability:** 1.0 

**- Justification:** 1.0 

**- Clarity:** 1.25 


*******************

2. **Manipulating Image Saliency by adding Image Artifacts**

Decision to grade as intentional or unintentional harm: **Unintentional harm**

**- Harm Base Score:** 20 

This type of harm can cause sever damage to the underrepresented demographic. 
For example, If there are 2 successful people in the picture and the AI crops out the black person.

**- Affected Users:** 1.3

Lots of users from underrepresented demographic use twitter and they might be affected by it.

**- Likelihood or Exploitability:** 1.0 

**- Justification:** 1.0 

**- Clarity:** 1.25
