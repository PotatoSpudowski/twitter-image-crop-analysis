## About You:
Hi, my name is Bahushruth. I recently graduated from "Manipal University, Jaipur" with a bachelors in Computer and communication engineering. I am currently a GRM Research Intern at IBM Research India. My research interests lie in NLP, Multimodal Research, Social Network Analysis, and AI Ethics.

## Readme:
Below are the list of different experiments performed and harms identified. 


1. **Erasure of Leftmost Face in a Group Picture** 

**Harm type: Erasure**

Similar to the dataset that the Twitter team used in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08667) to identify bias between 2 Race, I used the [FairFace dataset](https://github.com/joojs/fairface) to perform bias analysis on an additional 2 races (Indians and East asians) to obtain the following ranking results of different groups(based on race and gender) as seen in this [notebook](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic-Bias-Analysis-FairFace.ipynb). 

However, when the "pairing across all group" experiment as seen in the [notebook](https://github.com/twitter-research/image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic%20Bias%20Analysis.ipynb) released by twitter was performed, I noticed an interesting pattern. The left-most group exhibited very low saliency compared to the other groups. Hence I re-ran the experiment a few times with different ordering of the group in the image and found the same result.

Here are the results of the experiment.

This seems similar to a recent [controversy](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/vanessa-nakate-greta-thunberg-davos) involving a Ugandan activist who was cropped out of a news agency photograph.

Link to the Datasets I used for the experiments:
* [FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age](https://github.com/joojs/fairface)

* PNG Artifact images of guns, handcuffs, luxury watches, etc were downloaded using [Fatkun Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en). Link to the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHOMhNPyslhr5UggtL4z2GTZ-2JjQ5Bt/view?usp=sharing).

Download all the dataset files and extract them in the data folder to perform all the experiments.

* **Visual Images to BMI dataset** was obtained from contacting the authors of the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8666768)

**Please add the following to "Impact" field below:**

## Self-Grading Recommendation: 

1. **Erasure of Leftmost Face in a Group Picture**

Decision to grade as intentional or unintentional harm: **Unintentional harm**

**- Harm Base Score:** 15 

As seen by the latest controversy involving a Ugandan activist who was cropped out of a news agency photograph. This unintentional harm can have a serious impact on the individual being cropped out. Making them feel inferior compared to the other people in the picture. Based on the severity of the problem I recommended the above base score.

**- Affected Users:** 1.3

Anyone can be affected

**- Likelihood or Exploitability:** 1.0 

**- Justification:** 1.0 

**- Clarity:** 1.25
