Hi, my name is Bahushruth. I recently graduated from "Manipal University, Jaipur" with a bachelors in Computer and communication engineering. I am currently a GRM Research Intern at IBM Research India. My research interests lie in NLP, Multimodal Research, Social Network Analysis, and AI Ethics.

## Readme:
Below are the list of different experiments performed and harms identified. 


1. **Erasure of Leftmost Face in a Group Picture** 

**Harm type: Erasure**

Similar to the dataset that the Twitter team used in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08667) to identify bias between 2 Race, I used the [FairFace dataset](https://github.com/joojs/fairface) to perform bias analysis on an additional 2 races (Indians and East asians) to obtain the following ranking results of different groups(based on race and gender) as seen in this [notebook](https://github.com/PotatoSpudowski/twitter-image-crop-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Demographic-Bias-Analysis-FairFace.ipynb). 

However, when the "pairing across all group" experiment was performed, I noticed an interesting pattern. The left-most group exhibited very low saliency compared to the other groups. Hence I re-ran the experiment a few times with different ordering of the group in the image and found the same result.

Here are some results of the experiment.
